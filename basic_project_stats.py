# workflow_name is the name you gave your workflow (for sanity checks)
# workflow_version is [bigchangecount].[smallchangecount] and is probably pretty big

#       Includes browser information, language, started_at and finished_at

#       (the duration elapsed between consecutive created_at by the same user is another way)
#       the difference here is back-end vs front-end
# annotations (json) contains the actual classification information
#       which for this analysis we will ignore completely, for now
# subject_data is cross-matched from the subjects table and is for convenience in data reduction
# subject_ids has just the subject ids in the given classification
#       here we will ignore this too, except to count subjects once.
# we'll also ignore classification_id, user_ip, workflow information, gold_standard, and expert.

# Get the Gini coefficient - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient
#
# The Gini coefficient measures inequality in distributions of things.
# It was originally conceived for economics (e.g. where is the wealth in a country?
#  in the hands of many citizens or a few?), but it's just as applicable to many
#  other fields. In this case we'll use it to see how classifications are
#  distributed among classifiers.
# G = 0 is a completely even distribution (everyone does the same number of
#  classifications), and ~1 is uneven (~all the classifications are done
#  by one classifier).
# Typical values of the Gini for healthy Zooniverse projects (Cox et al. 2015) are
#  in the range of 0.7-0.9.
#  That range is generally indicative of a project with a loyal core group of
#    volunteers who contribute the bulk of the classification effort, but balanced
#    out by a regular influx of new classifiers trying out the project, from which
#    you continue to draw to maintain a core group of prolific classifiers.
# Once your project is fairly well established, you can compare it to past Zooniverse
#  projects to see how you're doing.
#  If your G is << 0.7, you may be having trouble recruiting classifiers into a loyal
#    group of volunteers. People are trying it, but not many are staying.
#  If your G is > 0.9, it's a little more complicated. If your total classification
#    count is lower than you'd like it to be, you may be having trouble recruiting
#    classifiers to the project, such that your classification counts are
#    dominated by a few people.
#  But if you have G > 0.9 and plenty of classifications, this may be a sign that your
#    loyal users are -really- committed, so a very high G is not necessarily a bad thing.
#
# Of course the Gini coefficient is a simplified measure that doesn't always capture
#  subtle nuances and so forth, but it's still a useful broad metric.

If you are using this code on an older project, where the data export is from
before subject_ids were exported as their own column, change "subject_id" below
to "subject_data", and then when you define the groupby "by_subject" and count
subjects, you'll need to use subject_data instead of subject_ids.

Apologies for doing this, but subject_data contains the whole manifest so for
big projects with big catalogs it can take up a lot of memory, so we don't want to
use it if we don't have to.
